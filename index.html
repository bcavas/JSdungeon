	<p id="story">Tuitt was once a peaceful and prosperous kingdom full of bright technomancers who have mastered all the programming languages known to man. This all changed with the arrival of the tyrant Jabba Skripp who seeks to enslave the talented people of Tuitt for his own nefarious schemes. Unskilled in combat, Tuitt's subjects quickly fell to Jabba Skripp's ferocious varvarians. It is up to you now, chosen one, to defeat Jabba Skripp and bring the kingdom of Tuitt back to its former glory.</p>
